A quick, satisfying curry that's packed with protein and flavour. The coconut
milk balances the heat beautifully — add more chilli if you like it fiery.

- 1 thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger, grated
- 1–2 red chillies, finely sliced (to taste)

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for
   8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden.
2. Add the garlic, ginger, and chilli. Cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.

## Chef's Tips

- *For extra depth, toast the whole spices (cumin seeds, coriander seeds) and*
  *grind them yourself.*
- *Stir in a big handful of spinach in the last 2 minutes for extra greens.*
- *Leftovers keep in the fridge for 3 days and taste even better the next day.*
