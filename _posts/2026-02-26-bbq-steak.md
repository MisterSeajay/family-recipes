The secret to a great BBQ steak isn't a marinade or a rub — it's heat, timing,
and patience. Get these right and you'll never want to cook steak any other way.
Serve with [garlic butter](/garlic-butter/) or
[peppercorn sauce](/peppercorn-sauce/).

## Ingredients

- 2 ribeye or sirloin steaks, at least 2.5cm thick (250–300g each)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- Flaky sea salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper

## Method

1. Take the steaks out of the fridge at least 45 minutes before cooking. A cold
   steak hitting a hot grill will seize up and cook unevenly.
2. Light the BBQ and get it ripping hot — you want glowing coals with a layer
   of white ash, or a gas grill on maximum. Place your hand 5cm above the grate:
   you should only be able to hold it there for 1–2 seconds.
3. Pat the steaks completely dry with kitchen paper. Brush lightly with oil and
   season generously with salt and pepper on both sides, right before grilling.
4. Place the steaks on the hottest part of the grill. Do not move them. Cook
   for 2–3 minutes until a deep brown crust forms.
5. Flip once and cook the other side for 2–3 minutes for medium-rare (internal
   temperature 54–57°C). Add 1 minute per side for medium.
6. If the steaks are thick, hold them on their edge with tongs to render the
   fat strip for 1 minute.
7. Remove from the grill and rest on a warm plate, loosely tented with foil,
   for at least 5 minutes. This is not optional.
8. Slice against the grain and serve immediately with your chosen sauce.

## Chef's Tips

- *Ribeye has more fat marbling and more flavour; sirloin is leaner and*
  *slightly more tender — both are excellent.*
- *A meat thermometer removes all guesswork: 54°C = medium-rare,*
  *60°C = medium, 71°C = well done (but please don't).*
- *Never press down on the steak with a spatula — you're just squeezing out*
  *the juices.*
- *If flare-ups happen, move the steak to a cooler zone; don't douse with*
  *water.*
