Marzipan is a classic Italian confection — *pasta di mandorle* — made from
nothing more than almonds, sugar, and egg white. In Sicily it is shaped into
beautiful fruit and vegetables; here it is wonderful eaten as-is, used to fill
chocolates, or rolled out to cover a cake.

## Ingredients

- 250g ground almonds
- 125g caster sugar
- 125g icing sugar, sifted, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp almond extract
- 1 large egg white

## Method

1. Mix the ground almonds, caster sugar, and icing sugar together in a large bowl.
2. Add the almond extract and egg white. Mix with a fork, then bring together
   with your hands to form a smooth, pliable dough. If it feels too dry, add a
   few drops more egg white; if too sticky, dust with a little icing sugar.
3. Knead briefly on a surface dusted with icing sugar until smooth.
4. Wrap tightly in cling film and rest for at least 30 minutes before using.
