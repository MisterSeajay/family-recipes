A proper steakhouse peppercorn sauce — rich, creamy, and full of heat. Made in
the same pan as the steak for maximum flavour.

---

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp green or black peppercorns, lightly crushed
- 1 shallot, finely diced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 50ml brandy or cognac
- 150ml beef stock
- 150ml double cream
- 1 tbsp butter
- Salt, to taste

## Method

1. After removing the steaks to rest, keep the pan on medium heat. Add the
   butter and shallot, and cook for 2 minutes until softened.
2. Add the garlic and crushed peppercorns. Cook for 1 minute.
3. Pour in the brandy and let it bubble for 30 seconds, scraping up any
   browned bits from the pan.
4. Add the beef stock and simmer for 3–4 minutes until reduced by half.
5. Pour in the cream and simmer for a further 3–4 minutes until the sauce
   coats the back of a spoon. Season with salt.

## Chef's Tips

- *If cooking on the BBQ, make this in a cast iron pan on the grill or bring*
  *indoors to a hob.*
- *Use green peppercorns for a milder, brighter sauce; black for more heat.*
